## Contributing

When adding new guides, follow these principles:

1. **User-focused**: Start with the user's goal, not the implementation
2. **Step-by-step**: Provide clear, actionable steps with expected outcomes
3. **Troubleshooting**: Include common issues and solutions
4. **Examples**: Use real examples from the `examples/` directory
5. **Testing**: All code examples should be tested and working

## Style Guide

- Use second person ("you") for direct engagement
- Include code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Add screenshots/GIFs for UI-heavy workflows
- Keep guides under 1500 words (break into multiple guides if needed)
- Link to ADRs for architectural decisions
- Link to API reference for detailed specifications
